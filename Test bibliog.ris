AB  - We recorded bat activity simultaneously at ground level and 30 m height using Anabat II bat detectors and Anabat ZCAIM recording units mounted on masts at seven sites of varying habitat type in eastern England. At the lower detectors 6194 passes were recorded; 90.02% of calls were from Pipistrellus; 6.91% were from Nyctalus/Eptesicus; 1.70% were Myotis/Plecotus; 0.13% were Barbastella and 1.24% could not be determined to species. At the higher detectors 484 passes were recorded from Pipistrellus (65.08%) and Nyctalus/Eptesicus (34.09%) and 0.83% were not determined to species. Total bat passes and the number of Pipistrellus passes were significantly higher on the lower detectors compared with the upper detectors. The difference between numbers of passes of Nyctalus/Eptesicus at the upper and lower detectors was not significant, despite proportionally more passes of these species being recorded at height. No extra species groups were recorded at height than were recorded at ground level except at one site where closed canopy broadleaved woodland surrounded the mast. Here, Nyctalus/Eptesicus species were recorded only at height. Overall, 28% of Nyctalus/Eptesicus passes and 5% of Pipistrellus passes were recorded exclusively at height, and not at ground level. Assessing bat activity levels from ground level detectors only can therefore be misleading, particularly when surveying high-flying species that are most likely to be at risk from wind turbine developments.

TI  - Understanding bird collisions with man-made objects: a sensory ecology approach
AU  - Martin, Graham R.
T2  - Ibis
AB  - Sensory ecology investigates the information that underlies an animal’s interactions with its environment. A sensory ecology framework is used here to seek to assess why flying birds collide with prominent structures, such as power lines, fences, communication masts, wind turbines and buildings, which intrude into the open airspace. Such collisions occur under conditions of both high and low visibility. It is argued that a human perspective of the problems posed by these obstacles is unhelpful. Birds live in different visual worlds and key aspects of these differences are summarized. When in flight, birds may turn their heads in both pitch and yaw to look down, either with the binocular field or with the lateral part of an eye’s visual field. Such behaviour may be usual and results in certain species being at least temporarily blind in the direction of travel. Furthermore, even if birds are looking ahead, frontal vision may not be in high resolution. In general, high resolution occurs in the lateral fields of view and frontal vision in birds may be tuned for the detection of movement concerned with the extraction of information from the optical flow field, rather than the detection of high spatial detail. Birds probably employ lateral vision for the detection of conspecifics, foraging opportunities and predators. The detection of these may be more important than simply looking ahead during flight in the open airspace. Birds in flight may predict that the environment ahead is not cluttered. Even if they are facing forward, they may fail to see an obstacle as they may not predict obstructions; perceptually they have no ‘prior’ for human artefacts such as buildings, power wires or wind turbines. Birds have only a restricted range of flight speeds that can be used to adjust their rate of gain of visual information as the sensory challenges of the environment change. It is argued that to reduce collisions with known hazards, something placed upon the ground may be more important than something placed on the obstacle itself. Foraging patches, conspecific models or alerting sounds placed a suitable distance from the hazard may be an effective way of reducing collisions in certain locations. However, there is unlikely to be a single effective way to reduce collisions for multiple species at any one site. Warning or diversion and distraction solutions may need to be tailored for particular target species.

TI  - A Guide to Bayesian Model Selection for Ecologists
AU  - Hooten, Mevin B.
AU  - Hobbs, N. Thompson
T2  - Ecological Monographs
AB  - The steady upward trend in the use of model selection and Bayesian methods in ecological research has made it clear that both approaches to inference are important for modern analysis of models and data. However, in teaching Bayesian methods and in working with our research colleagues, we have noticed a general dissatisfaction with the available literature on Bayesian model selection and multimodel inference. Students and researchers new to Bayesian methods quickly find that the published advice on model selection is often preferential in its treatment of options for analysis, frequently advocating one particular method above others. The recent appearance of many articles and textbooks on Bayesian modeling has provided welcome background on relevant approaches to model selection in the Bayesian framework, but most of these are either very narrowly focused in scope or inaccessible to ecologists. Moreover, the methodological details of Bayesian model selection approaches are spread thinly throughout the literature, appearing in journals from many different fields.  Our aim with this guide is to condense the large body of literature on Bayesian approaches to model selection and multimodel inference and present it specifically for quantitative ecologists as neutrally as possible.  We also bring to light a few important and fundamental concepts relating directly to model selection that seem to have gone unnoticed in the ecological literature.  Throughout, we provide only a minimal discussion of philosophy, preferring instead to examine the breadth of approaches as well as their practical advantages and disadvantages.  This guide serves as a reference for ecologists using Bayesian methods, so that they can better understand their options and can make an informed choice that is best aligned with their goals for inference.

AU  - Herborn, Katherine A.

AU  - Arnold, Kathryn E.
T2  - Behavioral Ecology
AB  - In captivity, personality types differ in behavioral flexibility: “fast” (neophilic, exploratory, and aggressive) types quickly form routines, whereas “slow” types continually adjust their behavior with environmental changes. If these differences extend to pertinent natural environmental changes, which indicate changing predation or starvation threat, then personality may reflect important variation in how animals manage risk. We examined whether personality traits classified in captivity would predict the behavioral flexibility of blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus as they foraged in the wild. Behavioral flexibility was defined as the tendency to adjust feeder use with changing winter air temperature, an indicator of starvation risk. At the population level, birds reduced their feeder use on warm days. Individuals, though, varied widely, with some instead using feeders at a relatively fixed, temperature-independent rate. Sex and size, correlates of dominance in blue tits, did not predict behavioral flexibility. Instead, behavioral flexibility was predicted by age and 2 personality traits: old, neophobic, and exploratory birds were more behaviorally flexible than young, neophilic, and nonexploratory birds. Our findings suggest that personality types differ in how they use information about their environments and hence cope with environmental change.

TI  - Effects of Weather on Corticosterone Responses in Wild Free-Living Passerine Birds
AU  - Romero, L. Michael
AU  - Reed, J. Michael
AU  - Wingfield, John C.
T2  - General and Comparative Endocrinology
AB  - Harsh weather can have devastating effects on both the survival and the breeding success of wild animals. Corticosterone, released in response to the stress caused by harsh conditions, may trigger physiological and behavioral changes that help ameliorate these effects. We examined three species of Arctic-breeding passerine birds for correlations between circulating plasma corticosterone levels and weather conditions at the time of capture. Furthermore, because persistently poor weather conditions may be required to initiate a stress response, we also looked for a relationship between corticosterone levels and weather conditions over the 24 and 72 h preceding capture. None of the three species showed substantial effects of weather on unstressed corticosterone levels during the breeding season, although one species showed a significant relationship with stress-induced corticosterone levels. In two species, however, variations in weather during molt (an energetically costly period when birds replace their feathers) explained from 35 to 88% of the individual variation in corticosterone levels. In a third molting species, weather conditions in the preceding 24 and 72 h explained between 20 and 30% of the individual variation in corticosterone levels. It thus appears that adverse weather may be a potent stimulator of corticosterone release during molt, but not during the breeding season. Although extreme weather conditions (those experienced once every few years) can disrupt breeding, since none of the birds abandoned breeding we might conclude that the storms in this study were well within the ability of the birds to cope physiologically.

AB  - Plasma corticosterone concentrations increase when birds experience a stressor, and in this study we quantified variation in corticosterone responses for the first time in a species of free-living bird. Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) nesting at Cape Bird on Ross Island in Antarctica were sampled on three occasions. Penguins with relatively low or high corticosterone responses on the first occasion had consistently low or high responses, as previously found for great tits and chickens. A model for birds is proposed in which birds with low corticosterone responses and proactive personalities are likely to be more successful (have greater fitness) in constant or predictable conditions, whilst birds with reactive personalities and high corticosterone responses will be more successful in changing or unpredictable conditions. There is thus no linear relationship between the size of a corticosterone response and fitness. Whilst the absolute magnitude of corticosterone responses varies markedly across species of birds, coefficients of variation are similar. Individual corticosterone responses are generally repeatable, with significant statistical repeatabilities for 30 min corticosterone concentrations and integrated corticosterone concentrations in the Adelie penguin, great tit and chicken. Coefficients of variation in corticosterone responses between birds and power analyses were used to provide a rule of thumb for determining differences between groups of birds in mean corticosterone concentrations to enable statistical analyses to have acceptable levels of statistical power for given sample sizes. It is suggested that power analyses and this rule of thumb be adopted in future investigations of corticosterone responses in birds.

TI  - Sight of a Predator Can Stimulate a Corticosterone Response in the Great Tit (Parus major)
AU  - Cockrem, J. F.
AU  - Silverin, B.
T2  - General and Comparative Endocrinology
AB  - The corticosterone response to the sight of a natural predator was investigated in free-living and captive great tits (Parus major). Free-living great tits responded to the sight of a stuffed, slowly moving Tengmalm's owl, a major predator of great tits, with warning calls and a change in behaviour around a feeder. Great tits returned to the feeder within a few minutes and began to approach the owl, and there was no increase in plasma corticosterone levels in birds sampled 30–50 min after they first saw the owl. Captive great tits in an aviary were exposed for 30 min to a stuffed Tengmalm's owl, to a stuffed brambling, and to a cardboard box. All three stimulus objects were slowly rotated during the exposure period. Great tits exposed to the owl changed their behaviour immediately, and spent most of the time when the owl was visible flying around the aviary and hanging from the roof, with very few visits to a feeder. Great tits exposed to the brambling and to the moving box also changed their behaviour and made fewer visits to the feeder. The great tits responded to the sight of the owl with a marked increase in plasma corticosterone levels, whereas there was no change in corticosterone levels (mean levels &lt; 11 ng/ml) in birds exposed to the brambling or to the moving box. Mean corticosterone levels were high (37.1 ± 4.9 ng/ml) 0.5 h after exposure to the owl, remained high (38.9 ± 6.0 ng/ml) 1 h after exposure, and had returned to basal (5.3 ± 1.3 ng/ml) 3 h after exposure to the owl. This is the first demonstration for any bird of a complete corticosterone response to a predator. The sight of a predator initiated a corticosterone response in great tits that could not move more than 3 m away, whereas free-living great tits that could choose how far to fly away from the predator either did not initiate a corticosterone response, or had a small corticosterone response in which corticosterone levels were not significantly different from basal 30–50 min later. The results indicate that the initiation of a corticosterone response in birds depends on whether or not a bird perceives that a stimulus is a threat. Furthermore, they illustrate the importance of not making generalised conclusions based on laboratory experiments.

Physiol Behav 62(3) 437–441, 1997.—Neurosympathetic and adrenal responsivity to manual restraint was studied in two White Leghorn chicken lines which differ in their tendency to feather peck. Blood samples were taken from freely moving cannulated birds during resting conditions and during manual restraint (placing the bird on its side for 8 min) to determine plasma noradrenaline, adrenaline and corticosterone. Plasma corticosterone levels in low feather peckers (LFP) were significantly higher during resting conditions and restraint as compared to the high feather peckers (HFP). In response to manual restraint the HFP hens showed a significantly larger plasma noradrenaline response than LFP hens. No difference in plasma adrenaline levels was observed under resting conditions or during manual restraint.

TI  - Applications of thermal imaging in avian science
AU  - McCafferty, Dominic J.
T2  - Ibis
AB  - Thermal imaging, or infrared thermography, has been used in avian science since the 1960s. More than 30 species of birds, ranging in size from passerines to ratites, have been studied using this technology. The main strength of this technique is that it is a non-invasive and non-contact method of measuring surface temperature. Its limitations and measurement errors are well understood and suitable protocols have been developed for a variety of experimental settings. Thermal imaging has been used most successfully for research on the thermal physiology of captive species, including poultry. In comparison with work on mammals, thermal imaging has been less used for population counts, other than for some large bird species. However, more recently it has shown greater success for detection of flight paths and migration. The increasing availability and reduced cost of thermal imaging systems is likely to lead to further application of this technology in studies of avian welfare, disease monitoring, energetics, behaviour and population monitoring.

T2  - General and Comparative Endocrinology
AB  - In evolutionary endocrinology, there is a growing interest in the extent and basis of individual variation in endocrine traits, especially circulating concentrations of hormones. This is important because if targeted by selection, such individual differences present the opportunity for an evolutionary response to selection. It is therefore necessary to examine whether hormone traits are repeatable in natural populations. However, research in this area is complicated by the fact that different hormone traits can be correlated. The nature of these trait correlations (i.e., phenotypic, within-, or among-individual) is critically relevant in terms of the evolutionary implications, and these in turn, depend on the repeatability of each hormone trait. By decomposing phenotypic correlations between hormone traits into their within- and among-individual components it is possible to describe the multivariate nature of endocrine traits and generate inferences about their evolution. In the present study, we repeatedly captured individual great tits (Parus major) from a wild population and measured plasma concentrations of corticosterone. Using a mixed-modeling approach, we estimated repeatabilities in both initial (cf. baseline; CORT0) and stress-induced concentrations (CORT30) and the correlations between those traits among- and within-individuals. We found a lack of repeatability in both CORT0 and CORT30. Moreover, we found a strong phenotypic correlation between CORT0 and CORT30, and due to the lack of repeatability for both traits, there was no among-individual correlation between these two traits—i.e., an individual’s average concentration of CORT0 was not correlated with its average concentration of CORT30. Instead, the phenotypic correlation was the result of a strong within-individual correlation, which implies that an underlying environmental factor co-modulates changes in initial and stress-induced concentrations within the same individual over time. These results demonstrate that (i) a phenotypic correlation between two hormone traits does not imply that the traits are correlated among individuals; (ii) the importance of repeated sampling to partition within- and among-individual variances and correlations among labile physiological traits; and (iii) that environmental factors explain a considerable fraction of the variation and co-variation in hormone concentrations.

AB  - In any field in which decisions are subject to measurements, interchangeability between the methods used to obtain these measurements is essential. To consider methods as interchangeable, a certain degree of agreement is needed between the measurements they provide. The concordance correlation coefficient is an index that assesses the strength of agreement and it has been widely applied in situations in which measurements are made on a continuous scale. Recently the concordance correlation coefficient has been defined as a specific intraclass correlation coefficient estimated by the variance components of a Normal–Normal mixed linear model. Although this coefficient was defined for the continuous scale case, it may also be used with a discrete scale. In this case the data are often transformed and normalized, and the concordance correlation is applied. This study discusses the expression of the concordance correlation coefficient for discrete Poisson data by means of the Poisson–Normal generalized linear mixed model. The behaviour of the concordance correlation coefficient estimate is assessed by means of a simulation study, in which the estimates were compared using four models: three Normal–Normal mixed models with raw data, log-transformed data and square-root transformed data, and the Poisson–Normal generalized linear mixed model. An example is provided in which two different methods are used to measure CD34+ cells. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Summary The classical concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) to measure agreement among a set of observers assumes data to be distributed as normal and a linear relationship between the mean and the subject and observer effects. Here, the CCC is generalized to afford any distribution from the exponential family by means of the generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) theory and applied to the case of overdispersed count data. An example of CD34+ cell count data is provided to show the applicability of the procedure. In the latter case, different CCCs are defined and applied to the data by changing the GLMM that fits the data. A simulation study is carried out to explore the behavior of the procedure with a small and moderate sample size.
