# 1. Introduction

This is the introduction of the text.

# 2. Methods
General methods text close to heaader.

## 2.1. Methods subsection 1

Here is some more methods text with a code block.

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
