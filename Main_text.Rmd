# Summary

1. While the effects of large wind farms on wildlife (particularly birds and bats) are generally well-studied and widely known, similar effects of small wind turbines (SWTs **give common UK dimensions**) remain relatively unknown. This is problematic, because rapid development and increasing accessibility of SWT technology have led to rapid growth of the number of SWTs installed worldwide.    

2. Although recent studies showed that bat activity is negatively affected by the immediate proximity of single operating SWTs, the potential for wider landscape-scale effects of multiple SWTs installed in clusters remains unstudied. By contrast, such cumulative effects are commonly considered in impact studies of large wind farms.    

3. We measured variation in bat actvity at a sample of **X** SWT sites in the UK, in order to test whether (1) accounting for variation in habitat, bat activity is generally lower in closer proximity of installed SWTs (e.g. 0-100m, compared to 100-200m, 200-300m, etc.), and (2) whether this effect is stronger in sites with multiple SWTs compared to sites with single turbines.    

4. After accounting for the effects of confounding variables (e.g. habitat and weather) we here provide evidence that bat activity is lower in close proximity (within 100m compared to 100-500m) from multiple, but not single SWTs. However, the strength of this effect is relatively weak, with the predicted probability of a bat pass **X-X**% within 100m compared to **X**% at 100-200m. **compare strength of effect with e.g. effect of habitat?**    

5. We conclude that (1) in accordance with previous findings, although bat activity can be adversely affected by SWT presence or operation this effect is relatively localised, (2) effects can be stronger at sites with multiple SWTs installed. We suggest that although future siting decisions for multiple SWTs should take account of the possibility of cumulative effects, the strength of these effects are likely to be limited relative to the effects of e.g. habitat or environmental variation.    

# Introduction

In this paper we aim to quantify and analyse the potential cumulative effect of SWTs on bat activity on a wider landscape scale (up to 500m from installed turbines). Specifically, using data collected at **X sites** throughout the UK we test the following predictions:

1. Bat activity is systematically lower in closer proximity (e.g. 0-100m from SWTs compared to 100-200m, 200-300m, etc) of operating SWTs, controlling for the effects of habitat and environmental conditions.    

2. The effect of SWT proximity on bat activity as tested in Prediction 1 is stronger in sites with multiple (2-4) SWTs installed compared to single SWT sites. Support for this prediction would indicate evidence of cumulative effects of SWTs.    

# Methods

General methods text.

## Sites

Data were collected at **X** SWT sites in central and eastern Scotland. Sites were selected from an existing database of owners **REF** based on how representative they were of common UK SWT installation settings in terms of habitat, turbine models and size. All turbines studied here were free-standing and between **X and X** in hub height, and all were in rural settings but specific habitat in the surrounding area varied (see **XX below**).

## Bat data

Bat activity data was collected between **XXX** and **XXX** 2013 and **XXX** and **XXX** in 2014. The time of data collection varied but started 30 minutes after sunset at the earliest and finished well before sunrise in all cases.  

Bat activity was measured along transects by 1-2 observers walking the length of each transect at a slow **give approx speed** and constant pace, using EchoMeter EM3+ bat detectors (WildLife Acoustics, Mass., USA). 
A target of four transects was planned for all sites, running out from the turbines (or the central point between turbines in the case of multiple turbine sites) in four cardinal directions. However, because of physical constraints (e.g. walls, impassible fences or ditches, houses or buildings) the actual number of transects per site as well as their length varied (Number: **X-X, mean X** per site, length: **X-Xm, mean Xm**). All transects were placed so that (1) the combination of all transects within each site covered all major habitats present, and (2) overall distance separating each transect was maximised. Transects were divided into 100m sections running out from the turbine centre point.  

One measure of ground level wind speed **anenometer make** was taken at the end of each section on each survey visit, and minimum daily average temperature measures for each survey visit were obtained from the **UK MIDAS weather station data at Grangemouth** **REF**.

## Habitat data and variable selection

Briefly, quantification of all variables. Refer to appendix for details of "initial" habitat data model selection. 

## Data analysis and statistics

### Measure of bat activity: probability of a pass per hectare surveyed

Bat activity was initially quantified as the number of bat 'passes' (**'pass' definition**) per transect section. However, we chose to analyse our data as bat activity presence or absence per transect section, per survey visit, for two reasons. First, the distribution of observed counts was so skewed (many zeros and excessive variation) that count-based statistical models did not provide any reasonable fit. Second, using bat 'passes' as a measure of activity provides only a relative measure of activity in he first place. In addition, because the area covered by each transect section varied slightly (see **Section X** above), we here model the probability of detecting bat activity per section and hectares covered.
